# Online Retail — Customer Segmentation with RFM & Clustering

Businesses across the world are growing rapidly. With technology, they can reach wider markets and serve larger customer bases. **Customer segmentation**—grouping customers with similar characteristics—helps teams understand behavior and tailor strategies for impact.

## 🧩 Problem Description

Identify the **major customer segments** from a transnational dataset covering **01/12/2010–09/12/2011** for a UK-based, non-store **online retail** selling unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers are wholesalers.  
The analysis builds an **RFM model** and applies **unsupervised clustering** to discover actionable groups.

## 💡 Why Customer Segmentation?

Differences in behavior, demographics, and geography enable meaningful grouping. Understanding segments helps with:

- 🎯 Target marketing  
- 👥 Client understanding  
- 🛒 Optimal product placement  
- 📈 Revenue growth

## 📐 RFM Model (Recency–Frequency–Monetary)

The **RFM** model is ideal when only transaction data is available:

- **Recency** – How recently did the customer purchase?  
- **Frequency** – How often do they purchase?  
- **Monetary** – How much do they spend?  

Combining these attributes quantifies customer value.  
*Example: A customer who bought recently, buys often, and spends more is a **high-value** customer.*

## 🔭 Approach

1. **Data inspection** (shape, types, nulls, duplicates)  
2. **EDA** (top products, countries, time trends)  
3. **Data preparation**  
   - Drop missing `Description` and `CustomerID`  
   - Remove returns (`InvoiceNo` containing “C”)  
   - Feature engineering: `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`, `TotalAmount`  
   - Log transforms for R/F/M; standardization  
4. **Create RFM model**  
   - `Recency = Latest_Date – last purchase date`  
   - Quartile-based scoring for **R**, **F**, **M**; build `RFMGroup`, `RFMScore`  
5. **Clustering & validation**  
   - **K-Means** (Silhouette & Elbow)  
   - **DBSCAN**  
   - **Agglomerative (Ward linkage)**

## ✅ Conclusions & Insights

### 🔎 Descriptive Analysis
- Missing values (notably `CustomerID`) and duplicates addressed.  
- Majority of purchases from the **United Kingdom**.  
- Peak purchase **days**: **Thursday**, **Wednesday**, **Tuesday**.  
- Peak **months**: **November**, **October**, **December**; lowest: **April**, **January**, **February**.  
- Peak **time of day**: **Afternoon**.  

### 📊 Segmentation Results
- Customers segmented using **RFM features**.  
- **K-Means (Silhouette & Elbow)** on RFM favors **k = 2** clusters overall.  
  - **Cluster 1 (Best/Loyal):** low recency, high frequency, high monetary  
  - **Cluster 0 (At-risk/Low value):** higher recency, lower frequency/monetary  
- **DBSCAN** surfaced an alternative **3-cluster** view (denser core + sparse groups).  
- Depending on business preference for granularity, both **2-cluster (clean split)** and **3-cluster (finer segmentation)** strategies are defensible.  

### 🎯 Business Actions
- **Best/Loyal:** loyalty perks, early access, cross-sell/up-sell bundles  
- **At-risk/Low value:** re-engagement emails, time-bound offers, win-back campaigns  
- **(Optional) 3rd segment (DBSCAN):** targeted nudges to convert “promising” customers into best
